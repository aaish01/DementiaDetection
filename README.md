# Dementia Detection
## Overview:
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Dementia project. The aim of this project is to develop a classification system that can accurately detect different stages of Dementia from a given set of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. Here, I have explored various Machine Learning Models and evaluated their performance using different evaluation metrics.
## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project consists of MRI images of the brain. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set to effectively train and evaluate the models. It has four classes of images both in training as well as a testing set: Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, Non Demented and Very Mild Demented.
## Machine Learning Models used:
- Kernel Support Vector Machine
- Multilayer Perceptron
- Voting Based Classifier
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- Extreme Gradient Boosting
- K Nearest Neighours
- Na√Øve Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
## Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy: ratio of correct number of predictions to total number of predictions.
- Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions out of the total positive predictions.
- Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive samples.
- F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
## Conclusion:
Based on the results, we can draw insights into the performance of each model. Further analysis and experimentation can be conducted to fine-tune the models and potentially enhance the overall performance.
